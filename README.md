### Configure CardScan SDK

#### iOS

Install and setup permission for CardScan iOS with directions [here](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ios#installation)

Also, the instructions to configure your API key in Obj-C is [here](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ios#configure-cardscan-objective-c)

The podfile in your `~/ios/Podfile` in your project should look similar to:
```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
  target 'Your App' do
  ...
  pod 'CardScan'
  pod 'react-native-cardscan', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-cardscan/react-native-cardscan.podspec'
end
```

#### Android

To configure API key, open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java` and add the following

```java
import com.getbouncer.cardscan.ScanActivity;
...

...
public void onCreate() {
  ...
  ScanActivity.apiKey = "ENTER_API_KEY";
}
```

Add cardscan activity to your manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
  <application
    android:name=".MainApplication"
    ...
  >
    ...
    <activity android:name="com.getbouncer.RNCardscanActivity" />
  </application>
```

## Using CardScan (React Native)

**Check device support**

```javascript
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.isSupportedAsync()
  .then(supported => {
    if (supported) {
      // YES, show scan button
    } else {
      // NO
    }
  })
```

**Scan card**

```javascript
import Cardscan from 'react-native-cardscan';

Cardscan.scan()
  .then(({ action, payload }) => {
    if (action === 'scanned') {
      const { number, expiryMonth, expiryYear } = payload;
      // Display information
    } else if (action === 'cancelled') {
      // User cancelled
    } else if (action === 'skipped') {
      // User skipped
    }
  })
```

## Running example app

Inside `example`, you can find an example React Native project that you can run.

To run the example app, do the following:
- Navigate to `example`
- `npm install`
- Update API key in `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/MainApplication.java` for Android and `ios/example/AppDelegate.m` for iOS.
- To run Android app: `react-native run-android`
- To run iOS app: `react-native run-ios`

## Troubleshooting

##### `ld: warning: Could not find auto-linked library 'swiftFoundation'`
* A workaround with XCode 11 is to add a bridge header https://stackoverflow.com/a/56176956

##### `error: Failed to build iOS project. We ran "xcodebuild" command but it exited with error code 65`
* A workaround with a newer XCode build system is to switch to the legacy build https://stackoverflow.com/a/51089264
